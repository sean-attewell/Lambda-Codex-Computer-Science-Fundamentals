# Python is not a statically typed language
# Every variable in Python is an object. You don't have to declare a variable's type.

# Type casting is a method used for changing the variables/ values declared in a certain data type into a different data type in order to match for the operation required to be performed by the code snippet. In python, this feature can be accomplished by using the constructor functions like int(), string(), float(), etc. The execution of the type casting process can be performed by using two different types of type casting, such as implicit type casting and explicit type casting.

# e.g. You can also cast a floating-point number to be an integer like so:

my_int = 3
my_int2 = int(3.0)
print(my_int, my_int2)

my_float = 3.0
my_float2 = float(3)

print(my_float, my_float2)

# strings

# It's common to use double quotes for strings so that you can include apostrophes without accidentally terminating the string.
my_string = "I don't have to worry about apostrophes with my double-quotes."
