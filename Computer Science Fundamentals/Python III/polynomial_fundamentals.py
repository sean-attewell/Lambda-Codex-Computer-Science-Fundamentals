# O(n^c)	As the input size increases, the runtime will grow at a faster rate. Polynomial (i.e. the variable that's growing is the base with an exponent rather than the exponent itself)

# Polynomial = many terms. e.g. 10x^7 - 9x^2 + 15x^3 + 9 or ... even just 6...
# Polynomials are defined such that they will have nonnegative integer exponents.
# 10x^-2 -9x^2 + 15x^3 +9 is not... you have to have non negative powers of your variables in each of your terms.
# 9a^1/2 -5 is not a polynomial not because it has a non-integer power. 
# Exponent can't be a variable either.
# A polynomial is a sum of a finite number of terms, where each term has a coefficient (any real number, positive or negative)
# multiplied by a variable, being raised to a non-negative integer power.
# In 10x^7 - 9x^2 + 15x^3 + 9
# 10, -9, 15 and 9 are coefficients. Because the last term could be 9x^0
# If you have one term it's alled a monomial e.g. 10z^15, or pi.x^5
# Binomial has two terms e.g. 9a^2 -5
# Trinomial has three terms.
# The degree of a given term of a polynomial is the power you're raising the term to
# e.g. 9a^2 -5 is a second degree term
# For a number on it's own like -5 you can either say the constant term, or the zero-degree term (since it can also be written as 5x^0)
# If someone asks for the degree of the entire polynomial, it is the degree of the term with the highest degree.
# e.g. 10x^7 - 9x^2 + 15x^3 + 9 the degree of the entire polynomial is 7th degree. It's a 7th degree polynomial.
# 9a^2 -5 is a 2nd degree binomial.
# Standard form for polynomials is where you write the terms in degree order. Highest degree term followed by next highest degree term etc.
# e.g. e.g. 10x^7 + 15x^3 - 9x^2 + 9
# The 'leading term' is 10x^7 because it's the first one
# The leading coefficient is the number 10.

# Quadratic: involving the second and no higher power of an unknown quantity or variable.
# e.g. ax^2 + bx + c
# Quadratus is Latin for square.
