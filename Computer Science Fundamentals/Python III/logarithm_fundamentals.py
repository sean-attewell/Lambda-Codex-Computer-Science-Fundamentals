# log base10 (1000) = 3 --> 10 to the power of what is 1000?

# When you plug in powers of 10, logarithms are a zero counting function!
# log(0.1) = -1
# log(1) = 0
# log(10) = 1
# log(100) = 2
# log(1_000_000) = 6

# each step as we multiply by 10, the output only goes up in increments of 1. So very slow growth.

# These are base for base 10 logarithms.
# So 10^0 is 1
# 10^1 = 10
# 10^2 = 100
# 10^6 =1,000,000

# So always remember: What the log wants to be, is the exponent!
# Specifically an exponent sitting ontop of whatever that base is

# Relations between three different numbers
# log base10 (1000) = 3 --> 10 to the power of what is 1000?
# 10^3 = 1000 --> What is 10 to the power of 3?
# 3ROOT1000 = 10 --> What to the power of 3 is 1000?

# Confusion comes from having 3 different notations. Either relative position of the number, introducing the radical symbol, or a word with 'log'

# log(a.b) = log(a) + log(b)
# 10^x + 10^y = 10^x+y
# logarithms are like exponentiation turned inside out
# multiplying on the inside is adding on the outside for logs
# so multiplying on the outside (the outputs) is the same as adding on the inside for exponents

# log(a^n) = n.log(a)
# (10^x)^n = 10^nx
#
# logarithms are like exponentiation turned inside out... so in base 10 log(a)
# the a corresponds to 10^x
# but the whole log(a) corresponds to just the ^x (because it's asking 'what is the exponent?')

# In maths generally log without specifying the base might be log base e, also written as 'ln', the natural log.
# In engineering it's often assumed log base 10
# In computer science it usually means log base 2

# Think of a log price chart.
# Expontential growth is often plotted with a log scale.
# On a logarithmic scale, big growth doesn't look that far away on a line of best fit
# Y axis goes up in where each step is multiplicitive (e.g. each step is 10x the previous level).
# The Y axis is now plotting not the total number of cases, but the logarithm of the total number of cases.
# i.e. a slowed growth version of number of cases?


# In mathematics, a radical expression is defined as any expression containing a radical (âˆš) symbol.
# Many people mistakenly call this a 'square root' symbol, and many times it is used to determine the square root of a number.
# However, it can also be used to describe a cube root, a fourth root, or higher.
