# O(c^n) As the input size increases, the runtime will grow at a much faster rate. Expontential. (the variable is the exponent, the exponent is what grows)

# All exponentials with a positive base will be positive values.
# Negative exponents mean 1 over. e.g. 3^-4 = 1/3^4 = 1/81
# As the negative exponent gets smaller (further towards negative infinity), the value gets closer and closer to zero.
# As the exponent goes positive, it explodes
# 10^6 = 1,000,000
# So kind of a zero adding function with base 10, the same way log base 10 can be a zero counting function.
