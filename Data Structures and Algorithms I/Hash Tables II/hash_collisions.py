# Remember when we wondered what would happen if multiple keys hashed to the same index, and we said that we would worry about it later? Whelp, it's later ðŸ¤ª.

# Let's say we were given the key-value pair ("Ryan", 10). Our hash code then maps "Ryan" to index 3. Excellent, that works!
# Now let's say after we inserted ("Ryan", 10), we have to insert ("Parth", 12). Our hash code maps "Parth" to index 3. Uh oh! Ryan is already there! What do we do?? ðŸ˜±

# Ok, let's stop freaking out, and let's think about this. If we don't do anything, the value stored at index 3 will just get overwritten. Meaning if we try to retrieve the value associated with "Ryan", 12 will be returned instead of 10. That might not seem like a big deal, but what if we were returning passwords based on a user ID, and we returned someone else's password. That would be horrible.

# Let's fix this problem. The most common way to solve this is with linked list chaining. If we see multiple values hashed to an index, we will chain them in a linked list.
